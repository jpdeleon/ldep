0. install 
1. get masses
2. compute expected semi-amplitudes
geometric mean of error

interesting properties:

host star brighter than Vmag


getting densities
get equilibrium


++++++++++method 1:
model each band separately
but single prior on rho_star 
(but will propagate on k and other params)

rho_star(P,k,b,etc) check Seager+2001

log_g, R* convert to stellar density
monte carlo simulation of error bars

check for convergence using Gelmann-Rubin statistic or acorr

++++++++++method 2:
simultaneous multi-band

>>take the MAP of sys and correct lc
>>fix sys coeffs for method 2 while transit params are shared
>>check uncertainties of transit params from results
of method 1 are 1-sigma with that of method2


check for convergence using Gelmann-Rubin statistic or acorr

DFM
try acorr


++++++++++++++++++++++++=
mersenne twister
gnu

categorize
low temperature and high temperature planet


* aim catalog of low density 

1. calculate theoretical rayleigh slope
2. consistent (<1 sigma) from theoretical rayleigh slope
3. 

* search for some rules correlation, temperature, etc. 
* given MuSCAT2: hundred nights
*
